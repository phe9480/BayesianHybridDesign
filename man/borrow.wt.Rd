\title{Borrowing weights from historical study}
\usage{
borrow.wt(
  Yc = 40 * 0.312,
  nc = 40,
  Ych = 234 * 0.312,
  nch = 234,
  nche = 40,
  a0c = 0.001,
  b0c = 0.001,
  delta_threshold = 0.1,
  method = "Empirical Bayes",
  theta = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Yc}{number of responders for control arm in current study}

\item{nc}{number of patients in control arm in current study}

\item{Ych}{number of responders for control treatment in historical study}

\item{nch}{Total number of patients in historical control}

\item{nche}{Equivalent number of patients borrowed from historical study}

\item{a0c}{hyperprior for control response rate beta(a0c, b0c)}

\item{b0c}{hyperprior for control response rate beta(a0c, b0c)}

\item{delta_threshold}{Borrow when abs(pc (current study) - pch) <= delta_threshold}

\item{method}{Method for dynamic borrowing, "Empirical Bayes", "Bayesian p", "Expected Bayes Factor",}

\item{theta}{A parameter with a range of (0, 1), and applicable to method = "Density Product" or "JSD", where the weight is defined as E_c((fch/fc)^theta) for "density product" and (1-0.5*(KL(fc|fbar)+KL(fch|fbar)))^(1/theta), and fbar=(fc+fch)/2.}
}
\value{
An object with values
\itemize{
\item a Global borrowing weight
\item wd Dynamic borrowingweight according to similarly of response rate
\item w Overall borrowing weight
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the borrowing weights for the hybrid control from historical study
